'''Expert system that can learn if it comes to something it does not know.
New Python commented below: 
   Multiple assignment works with lists (as well as tuples).
   eval(string) evaluates the string as a Python expression: eval('2+3') -> 5
   repr(object) produces a string version such that eval(repr(object)) == object
   aList[:] = bList  mutates aList so its contents become the elements in bList.
